            "For a more tranquil trekking experience, you can choose to climb Mount Singgalang, a dormant volcano near Bukittinggi. Unlike Marapi, this mountain is no longer active, and it offers lush forests and a crater lake at the summit called \"Telaga Dewi\" (Lake of the Goddess). It’s a favorite among hikers for its cool climate and beautiful views.\n",

            "Though technically located a bit outside of Bukittinggi, Puncak Lawang is a highland area offering jaw-dropping views of Lake Maninjau and the valley below. This spot is famous for paragliding, and it’s one of the best places in Indonesia to take to the skies for an unforgettable view of the region’s natural splendor.\n",

            "### **7. Koto Gadang Village**\n",
            "While more of a cultural destination, Koto Gadang is surrounded by gorgeous natural scenery. This village is known for its silversmiths and traditional crafts, but the location itself, nestled in the hills, is a treat for the senses. Combine cultural exploration with stunning views of the countryside.\n",
