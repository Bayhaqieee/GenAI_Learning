# GenAI Learning Hub

Welcome to the GenAI Learning Hub\! This repository is a collection of notebooks and applications focused on exploring and learning about Generative AI, Transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Projects and Applications

This repository is actively being developed and contains a growing number of projects that demonstrate different aspects of Generative AI and deep learning. Below is an overview of the key areas of focus:

  - **LLM-Powered Applications**: We are building various applications that leverage the power of Large Language Models. This includes projects like travel assistants, summarization tools, and other creative uses of LLMs.
  - **Deep Learning for NLP**: A significant portion of our work is dedicated to Natural Language Processing. We are exploring keyphrase generation, text classification, and other NLP tasks using advanced models.
  - **Fundamental Concepts**: We also have a collection of notebooks that break down the fundamental building blocks of Generative AI, such as the inner workings of Transformers, attention mechanisms, and positional encoding.

## Technologies

This repository utilizes a range of technologies for building and experimenting with Generative AI models. The key technologies we are working with include:

  - **Core Frameworks**: We rely on industry-standard frameworks like LangChain for application development and Hugging Face Transformers for accessing pre-trained models.
  - **Deep Learning Libraries**: Our models are built and trained using robust libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
  - **Optimization and Scaling**: We use tools like Deepspeed for optimizing and training large-scale models efficiently.
  - **Cloud Services**: We are exploring the integration of our applications with cloud-based AI services like Azure OpenAI to enhance their capabilities.

## Setup

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these general setup steps. For specific instructions, please refer to the individual project notebooks.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bayhaqieee/genai_learning.git
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Each project has its own set of dependencies. Please refer to the individual notebooks for the required packages. A general installation for `langchain` and `transformers` can be done via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -U langchain-openai langchain_community transformers
    ```

3.  **Run the Notebooks**:
    Navigate to the desired project directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the applications and models.
